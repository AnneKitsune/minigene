Implement an AIState enum in Rust representing basic behaviors (Roam, Chase, Attack, Patrol, Flee) with associated data (target IDs, waypoints, etc), including unit tests for serialization/deserialization and state validation. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Create a RoamingSystem in Rust that makes entities move randomly within a defined radius, with configurable cooldown between direction changes, including tests for boundary adherence, zero radius, and cooldown mechanics. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Implement a PatrolSystem in Rust using predefined waypoints with configurable arrival threshold, including tests for empty waypoints list, single waypoint, and looping behavior. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Develop a ChaseSystem in Rust that tracks target entities using their ID, with configurable detection range and pathfinding avoidance, including tests for target loss, out-of-range scenarios, and invalid targets. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Create an AttackSystem in Rust with cooldown timer, damage calculation, and range checking, including tests for attack interruption, cooldown enforcement, and invalid target edge cases. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Implement a FleeSystem in Rust that moves entities away from threats based on threat proximity, with panic duration and exhaustion mechanics, including tests for threat disappearance and multiple threat prioritization. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Develop state transition logic in Rust handling behavior changes (e.g., Roam â†’ Chase when threat detected), including tests for valid/invalid transitions and transition priority system. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Create a composite AISystem in Rust that processes all behaviors in priority order with interruption handling, including tests for state persistence and concurrent behavior conflicts. Use planck_ecs systems. If creating a component, create it in components.rs
Implement spatial partitioning optimization for AI systems in Rust using a grid-based approach, including tests for entity density edge cases and cross-partition detection.
