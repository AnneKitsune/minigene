Implement InputEvent enum with variants for game actions (Move, Look, etc.) and derive Debug, Clone, PartialEq for testing, including unit tests for variant creation and comparison
Create InputMapping struct using a Table to store key-to-event bindings and key combo sequences with methods for adding/removing mappings, including unit tests for valid/invalid key bindings and combo detection. Convert keycodes to u128 for use as the key in the table, rather than using random uuids for the keymap.
Implement ActionQueue struct with VecDeque<InputEvent> storage, methods push(), pop_last(), clear(), and next(), including unit tests for queue operations and order preservation. The next function will pop from the front and return the first elmeent.
Add combo state tracking InputMapping including current sequence buffer and timestamp, including unit tests partial sequence handling and canceling the combo. This will allow doing key combos for more advanced player actions. For example, ml for move right combo.
Create input processing system that converts key presses to events using InputMapping and updates ActionQueue, including unit tests for single/multi-key inputs and partial sequence and canceling scenarios
Implement clear (e.g., 'C') and undo (e.g., 'Z') key bindings and InputEvent modify ActionQueue directly in a different system called handle_queue_event_system, including unit tests for queue clearance and rollback operations
