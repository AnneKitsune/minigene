Minigene is a game engine currently specialized in ascii/2D tiled games and fast prototyping.
It is planned to support non tiled 2D and 3D in the near future.

Minigene is not a single crate, it is a collection of crates, an ecosystem for
game development.

For more information on the design choices of Minigene, visit the [blog](https://AnneKitsune.com/blog/2021-05-31_minigene_and_the_future/index.html).
